        At trackRX, we prioritize your privacy and data security. Our
        application is designed to store your prescription medication data
        locally on your device. This means that all data you enter into the app

        this data, nor do we collect, store, or share any of your personal
        information.

        is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
        security. As our application stores data locally on your device, we
        recommend that you take appropriate measures to secure your device
        against unauthorized access.
